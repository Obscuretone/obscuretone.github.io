title: The 7-10 Second Resume Review - A Flawed Approach to Hiring
description: This article critiques the common practice of spending only 7-10 seconds on resume reviews, highlighting the flaws in this approach and advocating for a more thorough evaluation to improve hiring outcomes.

In the fast-paced world of recruitment, the common mantra is that hiring managers spend a mere [7 to 10 seconds](https://hbr.org/2020/09/how-to-get-your-resume-noticed-and-out-of-the-trash-bin) reviewing each resume. This practice has become standard, leading many to question whether such a brief evaluation truly captures the essence of a candidate's qualifications. As someone who has navigated the hiring process both as a job seeker and a hiring manager, I have a hard time believing that this timeframe is anything better than chance.

# The Case Against the 10-Second Rule

## Superficial Evaluation  
When hiring managers skim resumes for less than 10 seconds, they inevitably miss critical details that could differentiate one candidate from another. This approach encourages a focus on superficial indicators—such as buzzwords or company names—rather than a deeper understanding of a candidate’s actual accomplishments and potential fit for the role.

Imagine you’re a recruiter sifting through hundreds of resumes. In 10 seconds, you might glance at the job title, the company, and a few bullet points. However, can you truly assess the value of a candidate’s experience or their unique contributions in that fleeting moment? It’s unlikely.

## Better Than Chance?  
The idea that recruiters can reliably select strong candidates in such a short time frame seems dubious. With limited time to form a judgment, they often resort to biases or gut feelings. This reliance on quick assessments can lead to overlooking qualified candidates simply because their resumes didn’t stand out within that brief window.

# The Numbers Behind the Process

Let’s put this 7-10 second rule into perspective. If a recruiter receives **200 resumes** for a single position and spends an average of **10 seconds** on each, that amounts to:

$$
200 \text{ resumes} \times 10 \text{ seconds} = 2000 \text{ seconds}
$$

To convert that into hours:

$$
\text{Hours} = \frac{2000 \text{ seconds}}{3600 \text{ seconds/hour}} \approx 0.5556 \text{ hours}
$$

That’s roughly **33 minutes** of total resume review time—just for one role. If the recruiter has **15 open positions**, they’re looking at around **8 hours** of total time dedicated just to skimming resumes. In a typical workday, this could mean that recruiters spend nearly an entire day merely glancing at resumes, without truly engaging with the content.

# A Fundamental Piece of the Recruitment Process

This approach to resume review raises a critical concern: the initial evaluation of candidates is a fundamental piece of the entire recruitment process. It is the very first step that sets the stage for everything that follows. If this step is rushed or undervalued, it can lead to significant repercussions throughout the hiring cycle.

* **Impact on Candidate Quality**: When recruiters only spend a few seconds on each resume, they risk missing out on highly qualified candidates. The initial screening is where potential talent is identified, and if it’s done hastily, it can compromise the quality of candidates brought in for interviews.

* **Ripple Effects on Subsequent Steps**: An inadequate evaluation during the resume review can result in hiring managers interviewing candidates who are not a good fit for the role, wasting valuable time and resources. This not only affects the hiring team but also impacts the overall productivity of the organization.

* **Setting the Tone for Engagement**: A thoughtful approach to resume screening can foster a more respectful and engaging process for candidates. When applicants feel that their resumes are being read with care, it enhances their overall experience and perception of the company.

# The Shotgun Approach to Applications

In today’s job market, many candidates resort to "shotgunning" their resumes—submitting the same resume to multiple positions across different companies in hopes of getting a response. This phenomenon arises partly because candidates often don’t receive feedback from their applications. When resumes aren’t reviewed thoroughly, qualified candidates become discouraged and turn to mass applications as a last resort.

As a result, an arms race emerges. Candidates begin crafting AI-driven resumes tailored to pass through automated Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) rather than reflecting their true capabilities. This, in turn, pushes hiring managers to rely more heavily on AI tools, further dehumanizing the process and making it more challenging for genuine talent to shine through.

# The Harvard Resume Effect

It’s no surprise that the so-called “Harvard resume”—a simple, clean, and structured format—tends to get better results. Why is that? It all comes down to the way information is presented. When recruiters know exactly where to look, they can quickly glean the most pertinent information.

## Saving Time = More Words  
Let’s break it down: if a recruiter saves just one second by using a familiar format, that precious second can translate into an additional five words read. In a world where every word counts, this small advantage can make all the difference. A resume that clearly highlights metrics and accomplishments will likely stand out more effectively than one cluttered with irrelevant information.

The standardized format allows recruiters to focus on key areas that align with their needs. They can quickly identify whether a candidate’s experience matches the job requirements and whether they have the quantifiable achievements that demonstrate their impact.

# The Need for a Reevaluation

This raises a critical question: should the recruitment process continue to rely on a 7-10 second review? If we acknowledge that this approach is fundamentally flawed, it becomes imperative to explore alternative methods that prioritize a more thorough evaluation.

## Rethinking the Process  
Recruiters might benefit from adopting a more balanced strategy—one that allows for a more in-depth initial review while still maintaining efficiency. Consider integrating technology, such as AI tools, that can highlight key qualifications based on the job description. This can help streamline the review process without sacrificing the quality of evaluation.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the 7-10 second resume review is not only insufficient but also potentially detrimental to the hiring process. As someone who values a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to recruitment, I believe that we must move beyond quick assessments based on chance. Emphasizing clarity in resume formats and allowing for a more substantial review period will lead to better hiring outcomes for both candidates and employers.

Let’s challenge the status quo and strive for a recruitment process that values depth over speed—after all, a well-crafted resume deserves more than a cursory glance. Investing time in this initial step is crucial; it lays the foundation for successful hiring and sets the tone for the rest of the recruitment journey. It’s time to end this arms race in the recruitment landscape and foster a more equitable, engaging, and effective hiring process.
