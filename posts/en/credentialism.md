As someone who has spent 15 years in the tech industry, I’ve seen firsthand how practical experience can often outweigh formal education. I didn’t have the financial ability to finish university, and realistically, I can’t take four years off work to pursue that now—nor should I need to. My journey has shown me that skills and real-world accomplishments matter.

However, in 2024's tech market, where hundreds of thousands are facing layoffs and resumes are often filtered by AI, not having a degree has suddenly become a liability. Despite my extensive experience, I’ve noticed that the absence of a formal credential can lead to overlooked opportunities.

# Experience Speaks Volumes

Throughout my career, I’ve driven policy and architecture for one of the largest websites on the internet, designed electronics, and written microcontroller firmware. These experiences have shaped my understanding of the industry and honed my problem-solving skills. In employee markets, where talent is in high demand, I’ve found that employers are often more interested in what I can do than in whether I have a degree.

1. **Skills Over Credentials**: Many employers today prioritize demonstrable skills over formal qualifications. My ability to create code that impacts millions of users speaks to my capabilities. Hiring managers increasingly recognize that relevant experience can be a better predictor of future performance than a degree.

2. **Evolving Job Requirements**: The tech industry moves fast. Skills that were relevant five years ago may no longer apply. I’ve continuously adapted and learned, which has made me a more valuable asset than those who may have relied solely on what they learned in school.

3. **Real-World Problem Solving**: My background in designing electronics and firmware positions me as a practical problem solver. This hands-on knowledge often proves more beneficial than theoretical learning, especially in an industry driven by innovation.

# The Employer Market Perspective

However, the reality shifts when considering the employer market. In many fields, especially those with a high demand for specialized skills, employers may still favor candidates with degrees. This inclination stems from several factors:

1. **Standardization and Risk Mitigation**: Degrees often serve as a standardized measure for employers to evaluate candidates. They can mitigate risk by selecting individuals with formal qualifications, even if experience suggests that a candidate could excel without one.

2. **Perception of Knowledge**: Some hiring managers equate a degree with a certain level of knowledge or commitment to a field. This bias can lead to skepticism about the skills of professionals who don’t have formal educational credentials.

3. **Networking and Opportunities**: Graduating from university can provide access to valuable networks and job opportunities that may not be as readily available to those without a degree.

# Conclusion

While a degree can open doors in some employer markets, my experience shows that practical skills and a proven track record hold significant weight, especially in tech. I’ve learned that innovation, adaptability, and real-world experience can lead to remarkable career success, even without formal educational credentials. However, as the job market continues to evolve—marked by layoffs and the prevalence of AI resume filtering—emphasizing experience over a degree may not just be an advantage, but a necessity.
